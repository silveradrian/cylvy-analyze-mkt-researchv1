# Pipeline Fixes Applied - September 17, 2025

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **YouTube Enrichment Made Non-Critical**
- **Issue**: YouTube API was failing due to SSL errors and circuit breaker tripping, causing entire pipeline to fail
- **Fix**: Modified YouTube enrichment phase to be non-critical - failures are logged as warnings and pipeline continues
- **Impact**: Pipeline no longer fails when YouTube API is unavailable

### 2. **Content Scraping Domain Filtering**
- **Issue**: Content scraping was re-processing ALL URLs from the pipeline instead of only new ones
- **Fix**: Modified `_get_content_urls_from_serp()` to check when content scraping was last started and only return URLs added after that timestamp
- **Impact**: Significant performance improvement - only new URLs from updated SERP results are scraped

### 3. **Company Enrichment Domain Filtering**
- **Issue**: Company enrichment was re-processing already enriched domains
- **Fix**: Added filtering logic to check `company_profiles` table and skip already enriched domains
- **Impact**: Reduced API calls and processing time for company enrichment

### 4. **Phase Status Tracking**
- **Issue**: Pipeline was re-running completed phases after resume
- **Fix**: Added proper phase completion checks and loading of existing results from database
- **Impact**: Pipeline correctly skips completed phases when resumed

### 5. **Error Handling Improvements**
- **Issue**: Generic error messages and AttributeErrors made debugging difficult
- **Fix**: 
  - Added specific handling for `asyncio.TimeoutError` and `httpx.HTTPError`
  - Added `current_phase` tracking throughout pipeline
  - Fixed enum mismatch (VIDEO_ENRICHMENT → YOUTUBE_ENRICHMENT)
- **Impact**: Better error messages and easier debugging

### 6. **Docker Health Check**
- **Issue**: Container was restarting due to failing health checks (missing `curl`)
- **Fix**: Added `curl` to Dockerfile system dependencies
- **Impact**: Container stability improved

### 7. **Circuit Breaker Integration**
- **Issue**: Circuit breakers weren't properly integrated with enrichment services
- **Fix**: Properly initialized circuit breakers for company and YouTube enrichers
- **Impact**: Better failure isolation and recovery

## Code Changes Summary

### backend/app/services/pipeline/pipeline_service.py
- Added domain filtering for company enrichment
- Added batch processing with timeouts for company enrichment
- Modified YouTube enrichment to be non-critical
- Added content URL filtering based on last scraping timestamp
- Added current_phase tracking throughout pipeline
- Fixed enum references (VIDEO_ENRICHMENT → YOUTUBE_ENRICHMENT)
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types

### backend/app/services/enrichment/video_enricher.py
- Enhanced SSL workaround with certifi certificates
- Added better error handling for SSL issues

### backend/Dockerfile
- Added `curl` to system dependencies for health checks

### backend/requirements.txt
- Added `certifi>=2024.0.0` for SSL certificate handling

## Results
- Pipeline now runs more reliably without constant monitoring
- Only new content is processed, avoiding redundant work
- YouTube failures don't break the entire pipeline
- Better error messages for debugging
- Improved container stability

## Remaining TODOs
1. Implement checkpointing to save progress within phases
2. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
