# Content Analysis Optimization Service Plan

## Overview
Build an AI-powered optimization service that uses OpenAI's flagship reasoning model to review and improve content analysis accuracy through advanced prompt engineering optimization.

## Architecture

### 1. Components

#### A. Analysis Review Service (`analysis_reviewer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Collect samples of analyzed content for review
- **Functionality**:
  - Sample diverse content types (10-20 examples per category)
  - Retrieve original scraped content and analysis results
  - Prepare context packages for reasoning model

#### B. Reasoning Engine (`reasoning_optimizer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Use advanced AI to evaluate and optimize analysis
- **Model**: OpenAI o1 or similar reasoning-focused model
- **Inputs**:
  - Original scraped content
  - Current analysis output
  - System objectives and context
  - Current prompt templates
- **Outputs**:
  - Accuracy assessment score (0-100)
  - Specific optimization recommendations
  - Prompt engineering improvements
  - Scoring model adjustments

#### C. Optimization Aggregator (`optimization_aggregator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Consolidate recommendations into actionable improvements
- **Functions**:
  - Pattern recognition across recommendations
  - Priority ranking of optimizations
  - Conflict resolution
  - Implementation plan generation

#### D. Analysis Updater (`analysis_updater.py`)
- **Purpose**: Apply optimizations to the analysis service
- **Features**:
  - Backup current configuration
  - Apply prompt template changes
  - Update scoring models
  - A/B testing capability

### 2. Data Models

```python
class AnalysisReviewSample:
    url: str
    content_type: str  # article, landing_page, case_study, etc.
    scraped_content: str
    analysis_output: dict
    company_context: dict
    timestamp: datetime

class OptimizationRecommendation:
    sample_id: str
    accuracy_score: float
    issues_identified: List[str]
    prompt_improvements: Dict[str, str]
    scoring_adjustments: Dict[str, Any]
    reasoning: str
    confidence: float

class AggregatedOptimization:
    optimization_type: str  # prompt, scoring, context, etc.
    affected_dimensions: List[str]
    recommended_change: str
    expected_improvement: float
    implementation_priority: int
    supporting_samples: List[str]
```

### 3. Workflow

#### Phase 1: Sample Collection
1. Query analyzed content from last 7 days
2. Group by content type and analysis dimensions
3. Select diverse samples:
   - Different content types (articles, case studies, landing pages, etc.)
   - Various industries
   - Range of analysis scores
   - Include edge cases

#### Phase 2: Reasoning Analysis
For each sample:
1. Prepare comprehensive context:
   ```python
   context = {
       "system_goal": "Accurately classify B2B content across multiple dimensions",
       "current_prompt": current_prompt_template,
       "scraped_content": sample.scraped_content,
       "analysis_output": sample.analysis_output,
       "expected_dimensions": {
           "jtbd_phases": ["Problem Exploration", "Solution Education", ...],
           "page_types": ["Article", "Case Study", "Landing Page", ...],
           "buyer_personas": configured_personas,
           "custom_dimensions": configured_dimensions
       }
   }
   ```

2. Submit to reasoning model with structured prompts:
   ```
   You are an expert in B2B content analysis and classification. Review this content 
   analysis output and provide optimization recommendations.
   
   Original Content: {content}
   Current Analysis: {analysis}
   System Objectives: {objectives}
   
   Evaluate:
   1. Accuracy of classifications
   2. Missed signals or context
   3. Prompt effectiveness
   4. Scoring methodology
   
   Provide:
   1. Accuracy score (0-100)
   2. Specific issues identified
   3. Prompt engineering improvements
   4. Scoring model adjustments
   ```

#### Phase 3: Optimization Aggregation
1. Collect all recommendations
2. Identify common patterns:
   - Recurring prompt issues
   - Consistent scoring problems
   - Dimension-specific challenges
3. Prioritize by:
   - Frequency of issue
   - Potential impact
   - Implementation complexity
4. Generate consolidated optimization plan

#### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Create backup of current configuration
2. Apply optimizations in stages:
   - Prompt template updates
   - Scoring weight adjustments
   - Context enhancement
3. Run validation tests
4. Monitor improvements
