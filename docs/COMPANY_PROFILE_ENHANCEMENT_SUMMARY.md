# Company Profile Enhancement Summary

## Issue Identified
The current company configuration only captured minimal information (name, domain, brief description), which didn't provide enough context for the AI analysis agent to properly evaluate content relevance and competitive positioning.

## Solution Implemented
Created a comprehensive company profile system that captures rich business context across multiple dimensions.

### Database Changes

1. **Enhanced Schema** (`enhance_company_profile.sql`)
   - Added `company_profile` JSONB column to projects table
   - Created validation function for profile structure
   - Added `get_company_ai_context()` function for formatted AI context
   - Created view for easy access to company context

2. **Profile Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "basic_info": {
       "full_name", "company_type", "employee_count", "funding_stage"
     },
     "business_model": {
       "primary_offering", "target_market", "pricing_model", "sales_cycle"
     },
     "positioning": {
       "value_proposition", "key_differentiators", "competitive_advantages"
     },
     "target_audience": {
       "ideal_customer_profile", "use_cases"
     },
     "brand_attributes": {
       "personality", "tone_of_voice", "core_values", "mission"
     },
     "competitive_landscape": {
       "direct_competitors", "market_category", "competitive_positioning"
     }
   }
   ```

### Backend Changes

1. **Advanced Unified Analyzer**
   - Now fetches comprehensive company context using `get_company_ai_context()`
   - Includes full context in every AI prompt
   - AI considers company specifics when scoring all dimensions

### Frontend Changes

1. **New CompanyProfileStep Component**
   - Multi-tab interface for organized data entry:
     - Basic Information
     - Business Model
     - Market Positioning
     - Target Audience
     - Brand Attributes
     - Competitive Landscape
   - Progress tracking (60% minimum required)
   - Contextual help and examples

2. **Setup Flow Updated**
   - Replaced basic CompanyInfoStep with CompanyProfileStep
   - Updated descriptions to emphasize comprehensive context
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

## Benefits for AI Analysis

1. **Context-Aware Scoring**
   - AI understands the specific business analyzing the content
   - Scores reflect relevance to company's actual needs

2. **Better Competitive Intelligence**
   - AI knows direct and indirect competitors
   - Can identify competitive positioning opportunities

3. **Strategic Alignment**
   - Content evaluated against company's value proposition
   - Insights aligned with strategic priorities

4. **Audience Relevance**
   - AI understands target market and use cases
   - Better assessment of content-audience fit

5. **Brand Consistency**

## Usage

1. **Initial Setup**: Complete company profile during onboarding (60% minimum)
2. **Ongoing Updates**: Review and update quarterly as business evolves
3. **Analysis Impact**: More complete profile = better analysis quality

## Migration Path
